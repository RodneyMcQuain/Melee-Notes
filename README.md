# Melee-Notes

Melee Notes is a note app for competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee players. It lets users record tournaments, sets, and games taking data from these records to query statistics based on user specifications for more than 5 different fields. The app also allows for notes to be taken about players, characters, analysis, and mentality alongside with reports on tournaments and money earned.

Note: This program was written in single class vJavaFX and as such has become messy and difficult to maintain. This repo will no longer recieve major updates. A rewrite in FXML has been started and can be found at: https://github.com/RodneyMcQuain/Melee-Notes-FXML.
